Sessions
--------

In oTree, a session is an event during which multiple participants take part in a series of tasks or games.
An example of a session would be:

"A number of participants will come to the lab and play a public goods game, followed by a
questionnaire. Participants get paid EUR 10.00 for showing up, plus their earnings from the
games."
